# VVS Selenium Test UI

## Introduction
The web application that you are going to test is located at https://www.saucedemo.com/.

## Requirements
Implement the following 5 test cases using Selenium and Java:

   1. Login for a valid user - 1 point
   2. Login for a user that is locked out - 1 point
   3. As a user, I want to sort the products by price from low to high (Sauce Labs Onesie should be the first product on the page) - 2 points
   4. As a user, I want to add three different products to the cart (the cart should contain 3 products) - 2 points
   5. As a user, I want to complete an entire flow for buying a single product (until checkout is complete) - 3 points

Your test class is located at [SeleniumTest.java](src/test/java/org/loose/vvs/seleniumtest/SeleniumTest.java) and the Selenium setup is already done for you.
